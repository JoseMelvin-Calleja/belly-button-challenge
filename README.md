# belly-button-challenge

In this project, we created an interactive dashboard of belly button data using javascript and html. Within the dashboard, there is a option menus to select different samples. With the sample selected, we created a bar chart of the top 10 bacteria in the belly button and a bubble chart to compare the sizes of each bacteria to each other.
